# Config file for devicehub-client

# Copy this file to the root folder of the project.
# Each root property is a config environment (ex. 'development').
# 'default' is a base config environment for the rest ones.

# When building with gulp, pass-in an environment variable
# to select which environment config you want to use.
# The env. variable must be called `DH_ENV`. Ex. `export DH_ENV=development`.
# If no variable is set, by default it is used `development`.

# In the following case 'development' env adds 'url' setting and
# overrides 'debug' setting from the default one.
