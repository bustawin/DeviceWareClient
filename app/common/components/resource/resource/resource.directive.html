<h1>Resource</h1>
<!--
  We will only pass the resource after getting it from server (the ng-if)
  this is needed when entering directly to a view (viewing a resource by entering through its URL)
-->
<resource-view resource="resource" type="big"></resource-view>
<!-- TODO Following original does not work <resource-view ng-if="resource.fromServer" resource="resource" type="{{type}}"></resource-view> -->
